# Cypress Automation Project

## Overview

This is a personal project aimed at automating end-to-end testing for web applications using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The goal is to ensure robust quality assurance by simulating real user interactions and validating application functionality across different user scenarios.

## Features

- **End-to-end testing**: Automates the full workflow of user interactions, from login to complex feature validation.
- **Cross-browser testing**: Supports testing on multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **Real-time feedback**: Instant test results and interactive debugging.
- **Fixtures and dynamic data generation**: Utilizes dynamic user data for each test to ensure uniqueness.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Can be integrated into Continuous Integration pipelines for automated testing during development.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
